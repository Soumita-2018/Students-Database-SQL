## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Soumita-2018/Students-Database-SQL.git
    cd Student-Database-SQL
    ```

2. **Ensure that an RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) is installed and running on your machine.**

3. **Create the necessary database and run the SQL scripts in the `sql` directory in the following order:**

    - `create_tables.sql`
    - `insert_data.sql`

## Usage

1. Open your preferred SQL client and connect to your database.

2. Execute the queries in the `queries.sql` file to interact with the student database management system.

## SQL Queries

Here are some example SQL queries included in the project:

- **Display all students enrolled in a particular course:**

    ```sql
    SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name
    FROM students s
    JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
    WHERE e.course_id = 'COURSE_ID';
    ```

- **Calculate the average grade for a course:**

    ```sql
    SELECT course_id, AVG(grade) AS average_grade
    FROM enrollments
    WHERE course_id = 'COURSE_ID'
    GROUP BY course_id;
    ```

- Other queries for retrieving and manipulating data related to students, courses, enrollments, and grades.

## ER Diagram

The ER Diagram, including constraints, keys, relationships, and metadata, is detailed in the project report (Project_Report.pdf) located in the resources directory.
